      A Bamboo config already exists here, so init left it as it is.

      To replace it with a new one, run ${quote(cmd, ' bamboo init --force')}.

export const thankYou = () => outdent`

  🚀 Thanks for choosing ${colors.cyan('Bamboo')} to write your css.

  You are set up to start using Bamboo!

  `

/**
 * What a project needs after `bamboo init`, which is the Vite setup: the plugin is what compiles
 * and emits the styles, and the stylesheet declares its own layers, so there is no `@layer`
 * statement to write.
 */
export const codegenComplete = () =>
  outdent`

  ${colors.bold().cyan('Next steps:')}

  [1] Add the plugin to your Vite config:

      import bamboocss from '@bamboocss/vite'

      plugins: [bamboocss()]

  [2] Import the stylesheet once, from your entry module:

      import 'virtual:bamboo.css'

      With TypeScript, reference its types beside vite/client:

      /// <reference types="@bamboocss/vite/client" />

  [3] Add ${quote('"prepare": "bamboo codegen"')} to your package.json scripts.

  See https://bamboocss.com/docs/installation/vite
